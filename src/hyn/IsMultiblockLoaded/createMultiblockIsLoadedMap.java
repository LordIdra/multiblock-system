package hyn.IsMultiblockLoaded;

public class createMultiblockIsLoadedMap {

    // What this class needs to do:
    // 1. Create an array of loaded Chunks from bukkit method getLoadedChunks()



    // 2. Check the array of loaded Chunks against the map of all existing Multiblocks and add the ones that match the array to a new array [MultiblockIsLoaded], probably by copying the data from one array to the other (is it possible to add data regarding the chunk its main block is in, say what chunk the lectern is in?)
    // 3. Pass MultiblockIsLoadedArray to the ticking routines

}
