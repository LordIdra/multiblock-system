package hyn.IsMultiblockLoaded;

public class createMultiblockIsLoadedMap {

    //What this class needs to do:
    //1. Create an array of loaded Chunks from bukkit method getLoadedChunks()
    //2. Check the array of loaded Chunks against the map of all existing Multiblocks and add the ones that match the array to a new map [MultiblockIsLoaded], probably by copying the data from one map to the other (is it possible to add data regarding the chunk its main block is in, say what chunk the lectern is in?)
    //3. Check MultiblockIsLoadedMap for Multiblocks that do not exist in the loaded chunks array and remove them from the map
    //4. Pass MultiblockIsLoadedMap to the ticking routines

    // Yes, i do understand that there are multiline comments, did it this way as i intend to insert code between the steps
    //Also, yes i am aware that this package is separate from the rest of the codebase, wanted to work on this myself because i am a masochist that jumps into the deep end learning code
    //It is 0549 and im soaking wet from work, so go easy on me.
